This prefab is a UI panel that lets players scroll through the list of connected players and teleport to one of them. There's also a "Hide me" option that removes you from the list globally.

--- IMPORTANT:
Drag and drop; no configuration required.

I recommend placing a single Find Your Friends panel in a place easily accessible from your world's spawn. That way players can freely respawn to access the panel again and teleport to new people.

As of version 1.1.0, TextMeshPro Essentials is required. Download via Window-->TextMeshPro-->Import TMP Essential Resources.

As of version 2.0.0, Udon Sharp is required.

--- LESS IMPORTANT:
You can place multiple panels in your world, but I don't recommend that for now, since references won't work as expected. I may add that feature in the future.

This prefab is available on github (github.com/jokerispunk) and I accept pull requests (you are encouraged to comment or talk to me first).

Thanks to FairlySadPanda (github.com/fairlysadpanda) for networking guidance, and thanks always to the VRCPrefabs community (vrcprefabs.com).

Thanks to Luna (github.com/harleyknd1) for greatly improving the look of the UI from my boring programmer art.
